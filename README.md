## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Robyn**, a student at SAIT in the Interactive Design Diploma program. I have some experience with HTML and CSS, and have previously applied for a role by coding a website from scratch using these languages, adding my resume and contact information (plus a photo of my dog, Baker) to the website. 

### A little about me:
- I love animals, especially dogs.
- I'm a big reader, and am always working through a book on my Kobo.
- One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games.
- I am a part of a weekly *Dungeons and Dragons* campaign with a group of friends.
